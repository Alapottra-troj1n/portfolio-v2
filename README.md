### A bit about my bio

My name is Sebin Song, a web developer who has worked at several organizations since 2020 as either a front-end engineer or a full-stack developer. During the early days of my career, creating interactive front-end animations on the browsers was my biggest passion but soon after I realised what truly makes a great web app is having a powerful server.So, enlarging server-side skills is my main focus as a web engineer.

### Outside the professional life

I do martial art trainning on a regular basis. I go to Muay thai kickboxing gym 3 times every week on average. It feels like I get to learn an important lesson about life from learning how to fight. To beat my opponent I have to constantly get into the danger zone where the opponent can hurt me. Sparring is pretty much facing and walking into this fear throughout the entire fight, and at the end of the day, it teaches me, to acheive something valuable involves enduring pain and overcoming the fear.
